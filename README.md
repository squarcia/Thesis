# Twitter Analysis
 
 ## Purpose

✅ The goal of this thesis is to analyze a dataset of 5,000 __Twitter profiles__ in order to highlight similar behaviors, 
   such as growth rate of *followers*, *growth rate of friends* and *number of tweets* made by various users.
   
✅ Having a general scheme of how a profile behaves, we can see if there are __outliers__, 
   i.e. profiles that differ greatly from the average behavior of a user: 
   these are the profiles on which we will focus and on which we will study the behavior.
   
   
 __*Note*__: 
 
 *I file .pickle non sono stati caricati per motivi di spazio.*
 
 *Lo script prevede che tali file siano all'interno di una directory nominata __"pickle"__.*
