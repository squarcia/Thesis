 ## Purpose

âœ… The goal of this thesis is to analyze a dataset of 5,000 __Twitter profiles__ in order to highlight similar behaviors, 
   such as growth rate of *followers*, *growth rate of friends* and *number of tweets* made by various users.
   
âœ… Having a general scheme of how a profile behaves, we can see if there are __outliers__, 
   i.e. profiles that differ greatly from the average behavior of a user: 
   these are the profiles on which we will focus and on which we will study the behavior.
   
## Problems and objectives of the analysis

ðŸ“Œ A large number of Twitter accounts are created to abuse the platform and put users' security at risk. In this way, malicious actors circumvent the suspension by    Twitter, as suspended accounts are immediately replaced by new accounts.

ðŸ“Œ It is critical to recognize these accounts as early as possible to limit their interaction with the platform.

ðŸ“Œ Studying newly created accounts in their first few weeks of "life" can help uncover characteristics of interaction on the platform that are useful in recognizing    malicious accounts.

## Main results

ðŸŽ‰ After 28 days, 22.5% of accounts have been suspended by Twitter.

ðŸŽ‰ The predominant topic in the Top 20 Tweeters was sharing URLs (e.g., one profile sponsored an Arab stock site, likely scam).
